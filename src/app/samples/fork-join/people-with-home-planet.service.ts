// A snippet of code that we could turn into a sample that demonstrates forkJoin
//
// Uses forkJoin to resolve related child entities from a foreign key
// for each of an array of parent entities.

// Discovered during workshop at ngConf 2018
// forkJoin, like Promise.all(), waits for all of its observables to complete
// before returning their results in an array
